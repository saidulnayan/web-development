Talking about the features of this system, it just contains both the admin section and the user section. The user can log in to look for various other notes/courses. While the admin can view all the users and manage them. The design of this project is pretty simple so that the user wonâ€™t find any difficulties while working on it. The admin can view and manage the users, view their uploads, and approve or delete their uploads.</h1>
